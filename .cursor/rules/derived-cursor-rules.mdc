## HEADERS

## TECH STACK

*   Added `jekyll` gem, replacing `github-pages` for Render.com deployments.

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

## CODING STANDARDS

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

*   **Hosting on Render.com:** When deploying to Render.com, use a `render.yaml` file for configuration to ensure reproducibility. This file should specify the build command (e.g., `bundle install && bundle exec jekyll build`) and the publish directory (e.g., `_site`). For root domain hosting, ensure the `baseurl` in `_config.yml` is set to an empty string (`""`).

## DEBUGGING

## LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT SETUP

*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ruby (2.7 or newer recommended)
    *   Bundler: Install with `gem install bundler`
    *   `asdf` (recommended) for managing Ruby versions.

*   **Steps to Build and Run Locally:**
    1.  Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        bundle install
        ```
        This installs Jekyll and the GitHub Pages dependencies from the `Gemfile`.
    2.  Run the Jekyll development server:
        ```bash
        bundle exec jekyll serve
        ```
        The site will be available at `http://localhost:4000` (or the port Jekyll indicates).
    3.  (Optional) Include drafts and future posts:
        ```bash
        bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --future
        ```

*   **Configuration Notes:**
    *   The site uses the `jekyll-theme-cayman` theme (configured in `_config.yml`).
    *   The `baseurl` is set to `/hosting-parsons-on-github-template`. Adjust this if running locally with a different base path.
    *   Jekyll automatically regenerates the site when files are changed, enabling live reload during development.

*   **Gem Management:** When deploying to Render.com:
    1.  **Preferred Gem:** Switch from the `github-pages` gem to the standard `jekyll` gem for a smaller dependency footprint and more control over gem versions.
        *   Remove `github-pages` from the `Gemfile`.
        *   Ensure `jekyll` and any necessary plugins (e.g., `jekyll-feed`) are explicitly listed in the `Gemfile`.
    2.  **Alternative (github-pages):** The `github-pages` gem can also be used on Render.com, but using the standard `jekyll` gem is preferred.
